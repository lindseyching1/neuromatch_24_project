Key Question:

How do imitation learning models simulate brain activity differently from traditional deep neural networks (DNNs)?

Other Objectives:

- How can imitation learning models illustrate the interactions and connectivity between different brain regions over time?
- How do the hierarchical layers of AlexNet align with human brain activity in terms of temporal and spatial dimensions as compared to MEG and fMRI data?
- What limitations exist in the functionality of AlexNet layers when reflecting the brainâ€™s image processing mechanisms?
- How do MEG and fMRI Representational Dissimilarity Matrices (RDMs) for different image stimuli categories compare to those generated by AlexNet and an imitation learning model?
- How does the multivariate pattern classification method used to create MEG RDMs affect the demonstration of object recognition in the human visual cortex, and how do different classifiers influence these spatiotemporal mechanisms?
